Level 1: DB Row

<p>The upper body horizontal pull movement pattern is one of the most important for developing upper body strength. A staple pull variation regardless of experience level is the dumbbell Row. The DB row involves flexion and extension of the elbow and shoulder, beginning with the dumbbell directly under the shoulder, pulling the dumbbell back and up towards the hip, and lowering with control until the dumbbell is again below the shoulder. The primary muscle groups involved include the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, rhomboids, posterior deltoids, and the biceps brachii.</p> 
<ul><li>Setup: Alloy Strength recommends using a bench, and placing one knee and hand on the bench in a “3 point” position. This setup makes it easier to learn proper rowing mechanics . As you level up, there will be other setup variations for the DB Row.</li>
<li>Grip: a common issue with rowing exercises is burying the bar too deeply into the palm. This works well for pushing movements, however for pulling or carrying movements we are much stronger in the fingers. Set your grip correctly by placing the DB handle in the first crease of your fingers.</li>
<li>Latissimus activation: a typical error in pulling exercises is to shrug and use the trapezius muscle excessively. Depressing (driving down) the shoulder blade and pulling the dumbbell towards the hip creates an ideal “packed” shoulder position and increases latissimus (lat) activation. The lat is the main shoulder extensor and is underactive in a large percentage of the population, including athletes.</li></ul>


Level 2: CC Neutral Row

<p>A common form of resistance used in pulling movements is the cable column (CC). A cable column is a pulley system that is typically attached to a weight stack. This setup allows variable force angles, and can allow movements with constant tension irrespective of gravity, making it particularly ideal for various pulling exercises. The CC Row involves flexion and extension of the elbow and shoulder, beginning with the pulley handles outstretched in front of the chest, drawing the elbows back along the ribcage until they are past the midline of the body, then returning to an outstretched position. The primary muscles group involved include the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, rhomboids, posterior deltoids, and the biceps brachii.</p>
<ul><li>Neutral grip: Select a handle attachment that allows a neutral grip, or the palms facing in towards each other. Set your grip correctly by placing the handle in the first crease of your fingers. As you level up, there will be other grip variations for CC Row.</li>
<li>Neutral spine: It can be very easy to sacrifice posture for range of motion or in an attempt to move more weight. Maintaining a neutral spine is crucial for proper shoulder and spinal health and stability, and will be the strongest position from which to pull even if it doesn’t feel like it at first.</li> 
<li>Scapular retraction: drawing back, or retracting, the shoulder blades is the ideal position to finish a row. Initiating by attempting to activate the lat and retract the shoulder blade ensures a “packed” shoulder position throughout the movement.</li></ul>


Level 3: > 45° Inverted Row

<p>The upper body horizontal pull movement pattern is one of the most important to perform to develop upper body strength. A common bodyweight pull variation is the inverted row. The inverted row involves flexion and extension of the elbows and shoulders, beginning with the lifter hanging underneath a bar, driving the elbows and shoulder blades back until the mid-sternum touches the bar, and lowering with control to finish at a full hang. The closer the lifter is to parallel to the ground the more difficult the exercise becomes. The primary muscle groups involved include the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, rhomboids, posterior deltoids, and the biceps brachii.</p>
<ul><li>Setup: position yourself at an angle greater than 45° relative to the floor. Your grip should be pronated, with the bar aligned in the first finger crease. The bar should touch at the mid to lower sternum</li>
<li>Elbows track close to torso: allowing the elbows to “flare” away from the body places a great deal of stress on the shoulder. Keeping the elbows at approximately 45° relative to the torso ensures a stable packed shoulder position and greater lat activation</li> 
<li>Pinch shoulder blades together at the top: drawing back, or retracting, the shoulder blades is the ideal position to finish a row. Initiating by attempting to activate the lat and retract the shoulder blade ensures a “packed” shoulder position throughout the movement.</li></ul>

Level 4: CC Pronated Row

<p>In a PRONATED ROW, select a handle that allows the palms to be pronated, or facing down. See the <b>CC Neutral Row</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 5: DB Tempo Row

<p>In a TEMPO ROW, the exercise is assigned a specific tempo for each three phases of movement: the eccentric phase, or muscle lengthening phase, during which the lifter is descending into the pocket, the isometric phase, or a pause in the pocket, and the concentric phase, or muscle shortening phase, during which the lifter is extending the legs to return to upright.The exact  tempo will be specified on your Strength Card as such: Eccentric/Isometric/Concentric. So, a 5/2/1 tempo would mean a 5 second descent into the pocket, a 2 second pause in the pocket, and a 1 second ascent to standing. The ascent, or concentric phase, will usually be marked as an “X”, meaning the lifter should attempt to “explode” and move as quickly as possible during this phase. See the <b>DB Row</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 6: < 45° Inverted Row

<p>For this inverted row variation, position yourself at an angle less than 45° relative to the floor. Your grip should be pronated, with the bar aligned in the first finger crease. The bar should touch at the mid to lower sternum. See <b>Inverted Row</b> for further details.</p>

Level 7: CC Pause Row

Level 8: BB Elevated Pendlay Row

Level 9: < 45° Weighted Inverted Row

<p>For this inverted row variation, position yourself at an angle less than 45° relative to the floor and add load greater than your bodyweight. There are a number of options  See <b>Inverted Row</b> for further details.</p>

Level 10: Pendlay Row

Instagram

<p>The upper body horizontal pull movement pattern is one of the most important to perform to develop upper body strength. A challenging variation to the barbell row is the pendlay row. The pendlay row involves flexion and extension of the elbows and shoulders, beginning and ending with the bar resting on the ground for each repetition. In a hinged position, the lifter pulls the bar to the lower sternum without moving the torso or using “body english”, slowly lowering the bar with control. The primary muscle groups involved include the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, rhomboids, posterior deltoids, and the biceps brachii.
