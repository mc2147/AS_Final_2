Level 1: DB Hip Thrust

<p>While multi joint, compound movements should be the main priority of any training program, accessory exercises can aid in the performance of the main lifts, especially those that improve the lifter’s ability to properly sequence the firing of different muscle groups together, also known as co-contraction. This is especially true of the posterior chain musculature, or the muscle groups of the upper back, lower back, and hips, which is often underdeveloped due to sedentary lifestyle factors. The most important muscle group in the posterior chain (and arguably in the entire body) are the glutes. The glutes are particularly underutilized, or “dormant”, in a large portion of the population, as most people tend to preferentially move through the knees and quadriceps instead. Sitting for long periods of time also contributes to glute dormancy.</p>
<p>The gluteal group includes the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus medius. The glutes combine to perform hip extension, abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, and perhaps most importantly, posterior pelvic tilting (tucking the hips under/forward) to create a neutral pelvic alignment and posture. Mastering the pelvic tilt has huge  carryover to strength, performance, and overall health, particularly low back pain.</p>
<p>The hip thrust involves hip flexion, extension, and pelvic tilting. The lifter sets up perpendicular to a bench, with the upper back on the bench, knees bent at 90°, and the dumbbell resting in the crease of the hips. The neck should be slightly flexed throughout the movement to maintain a neutral lumbar position. The lifter lowers the hips towards the ground, then extends and pelvic tilts to finish in a neutral hip alignment with the shoulders, hips, and knees all parallel to the floor. Resist the urge to hyperextend through the low back in an effort to achieve greater range of motion, as this movement is not coming from the hips and increases the risk of injury.</p>
