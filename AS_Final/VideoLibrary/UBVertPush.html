Level 1: DB Neutral ½ Kneeling Overhead Press

<p>The upper body vertical push movement pattern is key to develop upper body strength. A beginner vertical push variation is the ½ kneeling overhead press. The press involves flexion and extension of the shoulders and elbows, beginning with the dumbbell facing in at chin height, flexing the arm overhead to lockout the dumbbell over the midline of the body, and descending with control back to the starting position. The primary muscle groups involved include the pectoralis minor, the anterior deltoid, and the triceps brachii.</p>
<ul><li>Grip: a neutral grip, where the palm is facing towards the midline of the body, is initially recommended for vertical push movements. This is a safer and more stable position for the shoulder, avoiding internal rotation or an anterior glide (the shoulder rolling forward within the socket, impinging the anterior labrum). As you level up, there will be different grip variations.</li>
<li>Setup: the half kneeling position is a great place to start for vertical push movements, as it will expose imbalances through the torso or lack of shoulder flexion (ability to bring the arm overhead). The front knee should be at 90°, with the head, shoulders, hips, and back knee all stacked together and the back toes up. </li>
<li>Maintain tension through abdominals: a common mistake with vertical push exercises is arching/extending the low back and flaring the rib cage. Squeezing the glutes to keep the hips tucked and bracing through the abdomen keeps a “ribs down” torso position and helps maintain a neutral spine.</li>
<li>Forearms vertical at all times: it is important for the shoulders, elbows, and wrists to track together throughout the entire range of motion. Flaring the elbows outside of the wrist puts the shoulder in internal rotation and can create a great deal of stress in the anterior (front) capsule of the shoulder.</li></ul>
<p>The goal of vertical pushing exercises is to finish the movement with the load directly above the midline of the body. The ears are an easy landmark to use, and “biceps by by the ears” is a common cue to ensure proper lockout position. The movement of the arm relative to the scapula (shoulder blade) is known as “scapulohumoral rhythm”. When the arm is below the shoulder, it is important to keep the shoulder blade depressed (space between ear and shoulder). Once the elbow is even with, or above, the shoulder, it is important to allow natural elevation, or shrug, to occur for proper scapulohumoral rhythm and lockout position.</p>

Level 2: DB Neutral Seated Overhead Press

<p>Beginning vertical push exercises with a ½ Kneeling position is extremely challenging due to the unilateral stability required, and forces proper torso and glute bracing. This helps teach a strong posture from which to press overhead. However, it can be difficult to perform proper overhead mechanics in a ½ kneeling position, especially if you have limited overhead flexion. The seated position now allows for a chance to press from a more stable position, grooving scapulohumoral rhythm and lockout position. It is important to use the bench as a support, but not a “crutch”. Common issues with the seated overhead press include excessive arching/extension through the lumbar spine or slouching passively into the back of the bench. The knees should be at or greater than 90° to create tension through the lower body, with a tall neutral spine, with every effort made to support your own body weight as possible.  See the <b>DB Neutral ½ Kneeling Overhead Press</b> description for a full discussion of scapulohumoral rhythm and overhead mechanics.</p>

Level 3: DB Neutral Standing Overhead Press

<p>The upper body vertical push movement pattern is key to developing upper body strength. A common vertical push variation is the dumbbell neutral standing overhead press The press involves flexion and extension of the shoulders and elbows, beginning with the dumbbells facing each other at chin height, flexing the arms overhead to lockout the dumbbells over the midline of the body, and descending with control back to the starting position. The primary muscle groups involved include the pectoralis minor, the anterior deltoid, and the triceps brachii.</p>

Level 4: DB Alternating Seated Overhead Press

<p>In an ALTERNATING OVERHEAD PRESS, both hands are holding a dumbbell, but one arm remains fully extended while the other performs a press, alternating by arm for each repetition. A strong and braced torso position is necessary to avoid any rotation from the offset load and to maintain a neutral spine. See the <b>DB Neutral Seated Overhead Press</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 5: KB Bottoms Up ½ Kneeling Overhead Press

<p>In a KB BOTTOMS UP PRESS, a kettlebell is used instead of a dumbbell. The bell is elevated above the handle in a “bottoms up” position, creating much more of a grip and stability challenge.  See the <b>DB Neutral ½ Kneeling Overhead Press</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 6: BB Tall Kneeling Scrape the Rack Press


Level 11: DB 1A Standing Overhead Press

<p>In a 1A OVERHEAD PRESS, only a single dumbbell is used. The lifter performs all repetitions on one side and then switches. A strong and braced torso position is necessary to avoid any rotation from the offset load and maintain a neutral posture. See the <b>DB Neutral Standing Overhead Press</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>
