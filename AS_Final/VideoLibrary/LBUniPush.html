Level 1: Single Leg Press

<p>Bilateral movements are the foundation of strength training, as humans can produce much more force bilaterally. However, only training bilateral movements can lead to imbalances and increase risk of injury. It is important to include unilateral movements as well, which can aid in stability, coordination, mobility, strength, and overall movement quality and performance. It can be extremely challenging at first to perform unilateral exercises where the lifter’s bodyweight is unsupported, which is why the Single Leg Press is an appropriate introduction into single leg push exercises. The single leg press involves flexion and extension of the knee and hip, utilizing the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.</p>
<p>The leg press is an excellent opportunity to control and master proper knee tracking. Set up so that the working leg is in the middle of the machine. The shoulder, hip, knee, and ankle should all “stack” over each other vertically, with the knee following the pinky toe. It is especially important in unilateral movements to prevent any valgus, or collapsing in, of the knee, as this places a great of stress on the ACL and meniscus and increases the risk of injury. Maintain a neutral spine by keeping the lumbar in contact with the seat pad at all times. The opposite leg should stay bent and ready to “spot” and safely aid in finishing a repetition if something goes wrong.</p> 

Level 2: DB Reverse Lunge

<p>Lower body unilateral push exercises are some of the most important for developing strength, stability, and overall movement quality. Classic unilateral exercises include lunge or split squat variations. Forward lunge positions are difficult to perform and can often cause knee pain due to dysfunctional movement through the hips. The Reverse Lunge is a more knee friendly variation, and can help aid in learning proper activation through the hips for later lunge exercises. The Reverse Lunge involves flexion and extension of the hips and knees, holding dumbbells by the sides. The lifter begins standing upright, and steps backwards with one leg, descending until the knee is just short of touching the ground, then extends through the front leg to return to standing. The muscle groups involved include the gluteals, quadriceps, hamstrings, rectus abdominis, and spinal erectors.</p>
<ul><li>Stance: The lifter begins and ends in a standing position for each repetition, so it is extremely important that the lunch stance is consistent and stable. The feet should be directly in line with the hips, and the rear leg should step back far enough that the front shin is vertical (or nearly so) throughout the movement. While it is recommended to toe out slightly for bilateral push movements, in unilateral movements the toes should point straight ahead (neutral) or even toe in slightly, with the knee driven out over the pinky toe. This is a strong single leg position, and ensures proper glute medius activation, the main muscle responsible for stabilizing the hip. Make sure that proper symmetry is maintained, with the hips and shoulders parallel to the ground at all time.</li>
<li>Descent: During the eccentric movement phase, or time during which the back knee is descending towards the ground, the knee should drop straight down, without an excessive weight shift forward. Most of the weight displacement should be through the heel of the front foot, but a vertical shin angle should be maintained. Drive through the front leg to return to a standing position.</li>
<li>Hip hinge: a typical mistake in lunge movement is to attempt to keep the torso too upright. This causes the low back to arch/extend, the front knee to track forward excessively, and fails to properly activate the major muscles of the hip. Any lunge pattern should be initiated with a hip hinge. This will cause a slightly forward torso, which activates the glutes and hamstrings and allows a neutral spine to be maintained.</li></ul>

Level 3: DB Split Squat

<p>Lower body unilateral push exercises are some of the most important for developing strength, stability, and overall movement quality. The Split Squat involves flexion and extension of the hips and knees, holding dumbbells by the sides. The lifter begins and ends in a split stance, with the back heel off the ground and the front shin parallel. The lifter descends until the knee is just short of touching the ground, then extends through the front leg. The muscle groups involved include the gluteals, quadriceps, hamstrings, rectus abdominis, and spinal erectors.</p>

Level 6: DB Bulgarian Split Squat

<p>A “Bulgarian” setup refers to the position of the back leg. A Bulgarian Split Squat is also known as a rear foot elevated split squat, with the bag leg elevated on a bench or pad, typically a little less than knee height.  A higher or lower elevation may be necessary depending on limb lengths and hip anatomy. Feel free to experiment with different heights to see what feels most comfortable.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian position places even more of an emphasis on lateral stability and forcing the front leg to produce most of the force needed to complete a repetition. Except for the back leg position, the execution of bulgarian split squat should be nearly identical to a split variation with both feet flat on the floor. See the <b>DB Split Squat</b> description for a further discussion of split squat technique.</p>


Level 11: Zercher Split Squat

<p>In a Zercher Split Squat, “Zercher” refers to the placement of the barbell. The bar is set in the crook of the elbows, with the palms facing up and the hands directly in line with the elbows and shoulders. The Zercher setup introduces a significant anterior load as opposed to having the barbell on the back, effectively recruiting the muscles of the upper back and abdominal wall and forces the lifter to work hard to stay upright. See the <b>BB Split Squat</b> description for a further discussion of split squat technique.</p>
