Level 1: DB Goblet Squat to Box 

<p>The squat movement pattern is one of the most important to develop lower body strength. A common beginning variation of the squat pattern is a Goblet Squat to Box. The exercise begins in a standing position, with a dumbbell resting in the palms directly in front of the sternum. The lifter descends, squatting to a box with good technique and a neutral spine, briefly touches the box, and returns to a standing position. The primary muscles groups involved include the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, and the muscles of the trunk and core.</p>
<ul><li>Stance: the stance typically used for a squat is a “strength stance”, or approximately shoulder width apart. Exact stance width varies due to limb length and pelvic anthropometric differences. While some people prefer to squat with the toes facing forward (neutral), Alloy Strength recommends angling the feet out approximately 15 degrees. This “toes out” position aids in proper knee tracking and improves gluteal activation due to the external rotation at the hip. It is important to never “lock” the knees out, and instead keep them “soft” but strong.</li>
<li>An ideal “goblet” position involves the dumbbell or kettlebell resting in the palms, under the chin and in front of the sternum, with the elbows pulled in towards the dumbbell and the shoulder blades retracted (pinched back).</li>
<li>Hips engage first: Even though the greatest range of motion in a squat is observed at the knee, a proper squat pattern still begins with a slight hinge movement. This engages the musculature of the hip, especially the gluteals, and aids in proper knee tracking, weight distribution, and bar path.</li>
<li>Knee tracking: one of the most common and dangerous dysfunctions in a squat pattern is for the knees to collapse in towards one another. This is known as “valgus”, and places a great deal of stress on the supportive structures of the knee, particularly the meniscus and ACL, greatly increasing the risk of injury. Ideally, the knees track over the little, or pinky, toes at all times. This is a safe and strong position for the feet, knees, and hips.</li>
<li>Maintain neutral spine: Neutral spine: coaches often use the terms “flat back” or “table top back” to describe spinal positioning. However, this is incorrect as the spine is not truly flat. Every person’s spine has some degree of flexion, or rounding, in the upper back (thoracic region), and some degree of extension, or arching, in the lower back (lumbar region). While the exact degree of flexion and extension varies, and every person’s neutral spine may be a little bit different, a neutral spine is the guaranteed safest posture regardless of movement pattern or body positioning. It is very important to maintain a neutral spine throughout the entire hinge movement to help reduce risk of injury and improve performance.</li></ul>
<p>It is important to remember that a SQUAT TO BOX only utilizes the box as point of reference for range of motion. Rather than resting on the box, tension is maintained and a “touch and go” style of repetition is performed.</p> 

Level 2: DB Goblet Box Squat

<p>In a BOX SQUAT the lifter’s entire body weight slowly comes to complete rest on the platform. It is important to maintain tension and a neutral spine. A common error in a box squat is “rocking back” too far onto the box, changing torso angle to become too upright. This causes a loss of glute activation and excessive extension or flexion through the lumbar spine.  A good rule of thumb for box height is for the hip joint to be slightly above the knee joint when the lifter is on the box.  See the <b>DB Goblet Squat to Box</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 3: DB Goblet Squat

<p>A goblet squat no longer employs the use of a box. The lifter is now responsible for stabilizing their own body in the bottom position of a squat, or “pocket”. The exercise begins in a standing position, with the dumbbell or kettlebell resting in the palms, under the chin and in front of the sternum, with the elbows pulled in towards the dumbbell and the scapula retracted. The lifter descends, squatting as deeply as possible with good technique and a neutral spine, and returns to a standing position.</p>
<p>Notice within all of Alloy Strength’s squat pattern videos that parallel depth (descending so that the knee joint is even with the hip joint) is not required or discussed. Why? Some people are able to squat far past parallel with good technique, while others struggle to even come close, due to mobility or skeletal restrictions. Parallel depth is only required in the sport of powerlifting to judge a good lift. While ideally everyone would be able to squat below parallel, this is not always the case, especially at first. Instead, each individual should squat as deeply as they can while maintaining proper knee tracking and a neutral spine, and range of motion will improve over time.</p>

Level 4: KB/DB Front Squat

<p>The squat movement pattern is one of the most important to develop lower body strength. The dumbbell front squat is a common squat exercise variation, involving flexion and extension of the hips and knees. The exercise begins in a standing position, with the bells resting on the shoulders and clavicle, upper arms parallel to the ground, elbows facing forward, and the palms facing in. The lifter descends, squatting as deeply as possible with good technique and a neutral spine, and returns to a standing position. The primary muscles groups involved include the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, and the muscles of the trunk and core.</p>

This is known as “valgus”, and places a great deal of stress on the supportive structures of the knee, particularly the meniscus and ACL, greatly increasing the risk of injury. Ideally, the knees track over the little, or pinky, toes at all times. This is a safe and strong position for the feet, knees, and hips.</li>
<li>Front rack setup: a common mistake with any front squat variation is allowing the elbows to drop. Keeping the elbows high and even with the shoulders allows a strong rack position and maintains a neutral spine.</li></ul>

Level 5: DB Pause Goblet Squat

<p>In a PAUSE GOBLET SQUAT, the lifter is assigned a pause in the pocket of the squat before pushing through the legs to finish the lift. This is known as an “isometric contraction”, in which force is produced but there is no muscle length change, and is an excellent way to improve stability and strength. The length of the pause will be specified on your Strength Card. See the <b>DB Goblet Squat</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 6: KB/DB Pause Front Squat

<p>In a PAUSE GOBLET SQUAT, the lifter is assigned a pause in the pocket of the squat before pushing through the legs to finish the lift. This is known as an “isometric contraction”, in which force is produced but there is no muscle length change, and is an important (and often neglected) muscle action to perform. The length of the pause will be specified on your Strength Card. See the <b>KB/DB Front Squat</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 7: DB Tempo Goblet Squat

<p>In a TEMPO GOBLET SQUAT, the exercise is assigned a specific tempo for each three phases of movement: the eccentric phase, or muscle lengthening phase, during which the lifter is descending into the pocket, the isometric phase, or a pause in the pocket, and the concentric phase, or muscle shortening phase, during which the lifter is extending the legs to return to upright.The exact  tempo will be specified on your Strength Card as such: Eccentric/Isometric/Concentric. So, a 5/2/1 tempo would mean a 5 second descent into the pocket, a 2 second pause in the pocket, and a 1 second ascent to standing. The ascent, or concentric phase, will usually be marked as an “X”, meaning the lifter should attempt to “explode” and move as quickly as possible during this phase. See the <b>DB Goblet Squat</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 8: BB High Bar Box Squat

<p>The squat movement pattern is integral for developing lower body strength. A common way to prepare for the BB Squat is a BB Box Squat. The exercise begins in a standing position, with the bar resting across the upper back and trapezius, behind the lifter’s head. In a Box Squat the lifter’s entire body weight slowly comes to complete rest on the platform. It is important to maintain tension, a neutral spine, and proper knee tracking over the pinky toes. A good rule of thumb for box height is for the hip joint to be slightly above the knee joint when the lifter is on the box.</p> 

Level 9: KB/DB Tempo Front Squat

<p>In a TEMPO FRONT SQUAT, the exercise is assigned a specific tempo for each three phases of movement: the eccentric phase, or muscle lengthening phase, during which the lifter is descending into the pocket, the isometric phase, or a pause in the pocket, and the concentric phase, or muscle shortening phase, during which the lifter is extending the legs to return to upright.The exact  tempo will be specified on your Strength Card as such: Eccentric/Isometric/Concentric.

The ascent, or concentric phase, will usually be marked as an “X”, meaning the lifter should attempt to “explode” and move as quickly as possible during this phase. See the <b>KB/DB Front Squat</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 10: BB High Bar Squat

<p>The squat movement pattern is one of the most important to develop lower body strength, and chief among squat exercises is the barbell high bar back squat. The exercise begins in a standing position, with the bar resting across the upper back and trapezius, behind the lifter’s head. The lifter descends, squatting as deeply as possible with good technique and a neutral spine, and returns to a standing position. The primary muscles groups involved include the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, and the muscles of the trunk and core.</p>

Ideally, the knees track over the little, or pinky, toes at all times. This is a safe and strong position for the feet, knees, and hips.</li>
<li>Bar remains over midfoot: The goal with any squat pattern movement is to keep the load as close to the lifter’s center of mass as possible. Any drifting away from the center of mass places the lifter at a mechanical disadvantage and makes the lift much more difficult to execute. The center of mass in the sagittal (forward and backward) plane of movement is directly over the midfoot. Therefore, keeping the barbell over the midfoot during the entire range of motion is the ideal bar path for strength and performance.</li></ul>
