Level 1: CC Face Pull

<p>The face pull is one of the best accessory movements to aid in proper scapular mechanics and shoulder health. The movement is typically performed with a pronated (palms down) grip, with the thumbs pointed away from the body. The arms begin outstretched in front of the shoulders. The lifter then pulls the rope attachment towards the face while simultaneously externally rotating with the shoulders, finishing with the palms facing forward and the middle of the rope approximately nose height. The major muscles involved include the posterior deltoid, middle trapezius, and rhomboids.</p>
<ul><li>Arm action: the major movements that the arms are performing in a face pull are initial abduction, or moving the away from the sagittal (front and back plane) midline of the body, followed by external rotation (rotating away from the midline). While most rope attachments are not long enough for this to actually be the case, the goal should be to have the elbows at 90° at the end of the movement.</li>
<li>Scaps pinched together: the major movement that the scapula are performing in a pullapart is retraction, or moving away from the frontal plane (left to right plane). The scapula should also be depressed, or drawn down away from the shoulders. A common mistake with a band pullapart is to shrug the shoulders instead of maintaining space between the shoulders and ears.</li></ul>
<p>The face pull is a highly nuanced movement. Pay special attention to the order of operations, or “rhythm” of the arms relative to the scapula. Mastering this movement can lay a great foundation for strong, stable shoulders and pain-free pressing.</p>

Level 2: Band Pullapart

<p>The band pullapart is an important accessory movement to aid in proper scapular mechanics and shoulder health. The movement is typically performed with a pronated (palms down) grip, beginning with the arms outstretched in front of the shoulders. The lifter then pulls the band apart until it makes contact with the lower sternum, resisting the band with control until the arms are again in front of the shoulders. The major muscles involved include the posterior deltoid, middle trapezius, and rhomboids.</p>
<ul><li>Arms stay straight: the major movement that the arms are performing in a pullapart is abduction, or moving away from the sagittal plane midline of the body (front and back plane).</li>
<li>Scaps pinched together: the major movement that the scapula are performing in a pullapart is retraction, or moving away from the frontal plane (left to right plane). The scapula should also be depressed, or drawn down away from the shoulders. A common mistake with a band pullapart is to shrug the shoulders instead of maintaining space between the shoulders and ears.</li></ul>

<p>The band pullapart is a great way to begin to learn “shoulder packing”, or the ideal shoulder position for pushing and pulling, as well as how the scapula should “glide” across the rib cage.</p>
