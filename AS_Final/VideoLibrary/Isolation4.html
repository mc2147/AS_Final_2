Level 1: DB Lateral Raise

<p>While Alloy Strength focuses primarily on the multi-joint, compound movement patterns the body can perform, there is absolutely a time and place for isolation exercises in any good training plan. One important function that isolation exercises can fulfill is not only addressing weak or lagging muscle groups, but to activate specific muscles in <i>planes of movement</i> that are often neglected.</p> 
<p>There are three general planes of movement: the sagittal, or forward and backward plane, frontal, or side to side plane, and the transverse, or rotational plane. The vast majority of human movement occurs in the sagittal plane, and most of the exercises in the Levels Progression focus on improving strength in the sagittal plane. However, it is important to train all three planes of movement, and the Lateral Raise is an excellent way to improve shoulder strength and stability in the frontal plane. The lateral raise involves abduction (away from the midline) and adduction (towards the midline) of the shoulder. The lifter begins with the dumbbells at the sides, “pushes” the dumbbells away until the arm is parallel to the floor (90° at the shoulder), before lowering with control back to the sides of the body.</p> 
<p>The major muscle group involved is the deltoid. The deltoid has three distinct heads: anterior (front), posterior (back) and medial (middle). The medial head is primarily responsible for shoulder abduction. Be sure to work to isolate this muscle by maintaining scapular depression (space between ear and shoulder) without shrugging and having the trapezius muscle take over the movement instead.</p>

Level 2: BB Overhead Shrug

<p>In many of the techniques described in Alloy Strength’s Levels Progression, a large emphasis is placed on scapular depression, or driving the shoulder blades away from the ears. This is necessary for exercises performed with the shoulder below 90° of abduction, however when the arm is overhead scapular elevation is required for proper overhead flexion and scapulohumoral rhythm. Many people struggle with the correct overhead mechanics, and lack shoulder flexion or appropriate elevation due to a number of anatomical and lifestyle factors. Luckily, range of motion in flexion and elevation can easily be improved, and the Overhead Shrug is an excellent beginning exercise. The overhead shrug involves flexion of the shoulder, and elevation and depression of the scapula. The movement begins with the barbell pressed overhead. The lifter attempts to shrug the shoulders up to the ears, and pauses briefly before lowering to the starting position. The major muscle groups involved include the trapezius, serratus anterior, and deltoids.</p> 
<p>For people who lack overhead flexion and struggle to bring the arm fully overhead (biceps by the ears) a common issue is losing a neutral spine and arching through the low back to attempt to bring the arm into the proper position. Draw your ribcage down and tuck your pelvis by activating the glutes to maintain a neutral posture and ensure that the movement is coming from the shoulder. If you are unable to maintain a neutral spine for this exercise, the <b>Alloy Strength Warm Up Series</b> can aid in improving overhead flexion, and you can also perform the exercise with a single arm only, using a kettlebell or dumbbell.</p>
