Level 1: CC Neutral Pulldown

<p>The upper body vertical pull movement pattern is one of the most important for developing upper body strength. A staple beginning variation of the vertical pull is the Pulldown. The Pulldown involves flexion and extension of the elbow and shoulder, beginning with the arms overhead, drawing the elbows to the ribs until the hands are approximately level with the chin, then returning to overhead. The primary muscle groups involved include the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, posterior deltoids, and the biceps brachii.</p> 
<p>The Level 1 Pulldown grip is a neutral grip, with the palms facing in. The handle should be set in the first crease of the fingers. As you level up, there will be other Pulldown grip options. Proper initiation of vertical pull movements involve scapular depression and retraction (drawn down and back). A common cue is to “create space between the ears and shoulders”. This ensures a “packed” shoulder position and latissimus activation. To complete the movement, draw the elbows down to the ribcage, without allowing the elbows to pass far past the midline of the body. This prevents the shoulder from rolling forward into an anterior glide, which irritates the anterior (front) structures of the shoulder and compensating upper back posture, increasing the risk of injury.</p>

Level 2: CC 1A ½ Kneeling Pulldown

<p>It is important to perform both bilateral and unilateral exercise variations. Unilateral exercises require greater stability and promote proper pillar bracing and resistance of rotational forces (anti-rotation). A unilateral variation of the pulldown is the 1 Arm ½ Kneeling Pulldown. The half kneeling pulldown is especially challenging due to its unilateral nature in both the upper body and lower body.</p> 
<p>In a half kneeling setup, the front knee should be at 90°, with the back knee directly under the hip and shoulder. The handle should be in the opposite hand of whichever knee is forward (known as “contralateral loading”). The single arm position allows greater control of movement of the upper arm relative to the shoulder complex (known as “scapulohumoral rhythm”), however it can also be much easier for the elbow to track past the midline and create an anterior glide. Be sure to depress and retract the shoulder blade to activate the lat as much as possible to keep the shoulder and elbow in the proper position.

Level 3: CC Pronated Pulldown

<p>In a PRONATED PULLDOWN, select a handle that allows the palms to be pronated, or facing down. See the <b>CC Neutral Pulldown</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 4: 1A Tempo Pulldown

Level 5: Supinated Pulldown
