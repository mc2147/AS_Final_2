Level 6: CC Triceps Pressdown

<p>While Alloy Strength focuses primarily on the multi-joint, compound movement patterns the body can perform, there is absolutely a time and place for isolation exercises in any good training plan. The triceps play an important role in the “lockout” of upper body push movements, and proper activation of the the triceps is vital for shoulder and elbow health. In a Cable Column Triceps Pressdown, the lifter flexes and extends the elbows, beginning with the cable attachment approximately chest height. The lifter extends the elbow, pressing the handle until the arms are fully outstretched below the waist, then rising with control until the hands are again in front of the chest.</p>
<p>The triceps is comprised of three distinct heads, each with individual tendons and origin/insertion points. The long head, in addition to extending the elbow with the short and medial heads, originates on the scapula, and so is involved in shoulder adduction and extension as well. Therefore, a small amount of shoulder flexion and extension when performing triceps pressdown is appropriate, but the vast majority of the movement should occur at the elbow.</p>
