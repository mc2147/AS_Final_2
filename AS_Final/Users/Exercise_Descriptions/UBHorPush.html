Level 1: DB Bench Press
<p>The upper body horizontal push movement pattern is one of the most important for developing upper body strength. A great beginning variation is the DB Bench Press. The press involves flexion and extension of the shoulders and elbows, beginning with the arms extended over the shoulders, descending until the dumbbells are approximately level with the torso, and finishing with the arms again extended over the shoulders. The primary muscle groups involved include the pectoralis major and minor, the anterior deltoid, and the triceps brachii.</p><ul><li>Setup: the bench press setup position is often referred to as “5 points of contact” - the head, shoulder blades, hips, and both feet. All points must remain in contact with either the floor or bench. The whole foot does not have to be flat on the ground, but should be in a strong and stable position that feels comfortable, with a knee angle typically greater than 90 degrees. Common issues include popping the hips off of the bench or losing foot position, leading to an unstable base. A good rule of thumb is to align the bench so that the bar is directly over the lifter’s eyes.</li><li>Back position: a strong back position is essential to a stable and healthy press. This involves retracting (pulling back) and depressing (pulling down) the shoulder blades, which is often referred to as a “packed” shoulder position. Shoulder packing helps engage the latissimus (“lats”) and other muscles of the upper back, which keeps the elbows at approximately 45° relative to the torso. Maintaining the shoulder pack and elbow position, not allowing the shoulders to protract/“follow” the lockout or the elbows to flare excessively, is crucial for shoulder health and pressing strength.</li><li>Grip: a common issue with bench press is wrist “rollback”, or excessive extension. The creates an unstable wrist position and does not efficiently transfer force. By “burying” the dumbbell in the webbing of the thumb, the handle is as close to the wrist as possible, creating a neutral wrist with the middle row of knuckles on top as if the lifter is punching the ceiling.</li></ul>

Level 2: DB Floor Press

<p>The upper body horizontal push movement pattern is one of the most important to perform to develop upper body strength. A common push variation is the floor press, which is more shoulder-friendly due to the range of motion and can aid in the “lockout” of other press movements . The floor press involves flexion and extension of the shoulders and elbows, beginning with the arms extended over the shoulders, descending until both elbows come to a complete rest on the floor, and finishing with the arm again extended over the shoulders. The primary muscle groups involved include the pectoralis major and minor, the anterior deltoid, and the triceps brachii.</p><ul><li>Setup: the ideal position for the dumbbells is at the hips. This allows the lifter to properly set the upper back, retracting (pulling back) and depressing (pulling down) the shoulder blades and keeping the elbows close. The lifter can then rock back directly into the proper position to press.</li><li>Elbows come to a complete rest on the floor: a common issue with floor press is bouncing the elbows off of the ground, which negates the contribution of the triceps. Resting the elbows improves starting strength, or the ability to produce force from a static position.</li><li>Elbows stay directly below wrist: excessive flaring of the elbows outside of the wrists is a common issue in horizontal pressing movements. This places the shoulder in internal rotation.</li><li>Lats stay engaged: latissimus activation aids in maintaining a packed shoulder and proper elbow position at approximately 45° relative to the torso.</li></ul>


Level 3: DB Alternating Bench Press

<p>In an ALTERNATING BENCH PRESS, both hands are holding a dumbbell, but one arm remains fully extended while the other performs a press, alternating by arm for each repetition. See the <b>DB Bench Press</b> description for other coaching cues.</p> 

Level 4: DB Alternating Floor Press

<p>In an ALTERNATING FLOOR PRESS, both hands are holding a dumbbell, but one arm remains fully extended while the other performs a press, alternating by arm for each repetition. See the <b>DB Floor Press</b> description for other coaching cues.</p> 

Level 5: DB 1A Bench Press

<p>In a 1A BENCH PRESS, only a single dumbbell is used. The lifter performs all repetitions on one side and then switches. In both instances, a strong and braced torso position is necessary to avoid any rotation from the offset load. See the <b>DB Bench Press</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 6: BB Bench Press

<p>The upper body horizontal push movement pattern is one of the most important for developing upper body strength, and chief among horizontal push movements is the barbell bench press. The bench press involves flexion and extension of the shoulders and elbows, beginning with the arms extended over the shoulders, descending until both elbows come to a complete rest on the lower chest, and finishing with the arm again extended over the shoulders. The primary muscle groups involved include the pectoralis major and minor, the anterior deltoid, and the triceps brachii.</p><ul><li>Setup: the bench press setup position is often referred to as “5 points of contact” - the head, shoulder blades, hips, and both feet.

By “burying” the bar in the webbing of the thumb, the bar is as close to the wrist as possible, creating a neutral wrist with the middle row of knuckles on top of the bar as if the lifter is punching the ceiling.</li><li>Grip width: how far apart the hands are placed varies by lifter due to shoulder anthropometry, limb lengths, and personal preference.  A good rule of thumb for hand placement is 1.5 times biacromial width, or 1.5 times the length of both clavicles (collar bones). Regardless of grip width, the elbows must track directly under the wrist at all times.</li><li>Bar path: contrary to popular belief, the ideal bench press bar path is not exclusively vertical. “Pulling” the bar to the lower sternum ensures proper shoulder packing and latissimus activation, which is essential for a stable and strong platform from which to press. If this is achieved, the bar will naturally drift horizontally towards the head during concentric lockout.</li></ul>

Level 7: DB 1A Floor Press

<p>In a 1A FLOOR PRESS, only a single dumbbell is used. The lifter performs all repetitions on one side and then switches. In both instances, a strong and braced torso position is necessary to avoid any rotation from the offset load.</p>

Level 11: BB Pause Bench Press

<p>In a BB PAUSE BENCH PRESS, the bar comes to a complete rest at the lower sternum before completing the repetition. This helps to avoid bouncing the bar off the chest, which can increase the risk of injury, and improves joint track and starting strength, or the ability to produce force from a static position. See the <b>BB Bench Press</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>
