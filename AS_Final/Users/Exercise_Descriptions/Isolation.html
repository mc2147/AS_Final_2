Level 1: DB Biceps Curl

<p>While Alloy Strength focuses primarily on the multi-joint, compound movement patterns the body can perform, there is absolutely a time and place for isolation exercises in any good training plan. While the biceps are easily the most overly trained muscle in the body, they play an important role in upper body movements and shoulder and elbow health. In a DB Biceps curl, the dumbbells begin at the side of the torso with the palms supinated (facing up). The lifter flexes the elbows, pulling the hands towards the shoulders, then lowering with control until the dumbbells are again resting under the shoulders. The major muscles involved include the biceps brachii, brachialis, and forearm flexors.</p> 
<p>It is important to keep the scapula retracted and depressed, and to perform each repetition with control, in order to prevent extra contribution from the muscles of the upper back or any cheating “swinging” repetitions. The goal of isolation work is to activate a very specific muscle group. Be sure to select an appropriate weight that isn’t too heavy for the proper muscles to handle, otherwise larger and stronger muscles will take over.</p>
<p>There are three main functions of the biceps brachii: elbow flexion, forearm supination, and shoulder flexion/humoral depression. A common error when performing curls (especially when using weight that is too heavy) is for the elbows to instead track behind the midline of the body instead of moving forward and up. It is ideal for the elbows to rise slightly at the end range of motion of a biceps curl, which aids in anterior shoulder stability and health.</p>


Level 2: DB Hammer Curl

<p>A hammer curl is a common variation of a biceps curl in which a neutral grip (palms facing in) is utilized. This curl version more effectively targets the brachialis, an important synergistic muscle of the biceps that aids in elbow flexion. The brachialis is mostly comprised of low threshold, oxidative (“Type 1”) motor units, meaning that it responds well to low velocity movement. Pausing at the end range of motion and lowering with control will most effectively activate the brachialis.</p>
