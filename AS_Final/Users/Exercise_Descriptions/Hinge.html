Level 1
<p>The hinge movement pattern is one of the most important for developing total body strength. A common variation of the hinge is the Romanian deadlift, or RDL. The RDL involves flexion and extension of the hips, beginning with the lifter standing fully upright, flexing the hips back or “hinging” until the torso is nearly parallel to the ground, and extending the hips to return upright again. The primary muscles groups involved include the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, spinal erectors, latissimus dorsi, and the forearms/hands.</p>
<ul><li>Stance: the stance used for a typical hinge pattern is a "power stance", directly under the hips. An easy way to find the proper stance is to close your eyes and take a small hop; your feet should land directly where they need to be. It is important to never “lock” the knees out, and instead keep them “soft” but strong.</li><li>Grip: Alloy Strength recommends using a double overhand grip for DB RDL, with the dumbbells sliding across the front of the thighs and maintaining contact. Some people prefer to have a neutral grip with the dumbbells on the sides of the body, but this can often create faulty mechanics where the lifter attempts to “squat” the weight, and bend at the knee instead.</li><li>Neutral spine: coaches often use the terms “flat back” or “table top back” to describe spinal positioning. However, this is incorrect as the spine is not truly flat. Every person’s spine has some degree of flexion, or rounding, in the upper back (thoracic region), and some degree of extension, or arching, in the lower back (lumbar region). While the exact degree of flexion and extension varies, and every person’s neutral spine may be a little bit different, a neutral spine is the guaranteed safest posture regardless of movement pattern or body positioning. It is very important to maintain a neutral spine throughout the entire hinge movement to help reduce risk of injury and improve performance.</li>
</ul><p>Hamstring flexibility and the ability to maintain a neutral spine determine ultimate range of motion for an RDL. The goal of an RDL is to maximize the true hinge capability of the hips, and maintain a vertical shin with minimum flexion or extension of the knee. Once the hamstrings reach terminal length, to move any farther we would either have to bend at the knee or lose a neutral spine. Neither is ideal, and so once the hamstrings are “tight” the lifter should return to an upright position. Proper movement quality will improve range of motion over time.</p>

Level 2
<p>In a PAUSE RDL, the lifter is assigned a pause in the bottom lengthened position, or “pocket”. This is known as an “isometric contraction”, in which force is produced but there is no muscle length change, and is an excellent way to improve stability and strength. The length of the pause will be specified on your Strength Card, but will typically be 2-5 seconds. See the <b>DB RDL</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 4
<p>In a TEMPO RDL, the exercise is assigned a specific tempo for each three phases of movement: the eccentric phase, or muscle lengthening phase, during which the lifter is descending into the pocket, the isometric phase, or a pause in the pocket, and the concentric phase, or muscle shortening phase, during which the lifter is extending the legs to return to upright.The exact tempo will be specified on your Strength Card as such:</p><p>Eccentric/Isometric/Concentric. So, a 3/2/1 tempo would mean a 3 second descent into the pocket, a 2 second pause in the pocket, and a 1 second ascent to standing. The ascent, or concentric phase, will usually be marked as an “X”, meaning the lifter should attempt to “explode” and move as quickly as possible during this phase. See the <b>DB RDL</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

This is known as an “isometric contraction”, in which force is produced but there is no muscle length change, and is an excellent way to improve stability and strength. The length of the pause will be specified on your Strength Card. See the <b>BB RDL</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 6
<p>The TRAP BAR is a commonly used speciality bar that works well for hinge and carry exercises. A trap bar is typically hexagonal or octagonal in shape, with handles (usually elevated) on either side, and the lifter stands inside of the bar. Due to the elevated handles and neutral grip alignment, the trap bar deadlift is an excellent way to learn a proper setup from the floor as preparation for the BB Deadlift. The trap bar deadlift involves extension of the hips and knees, with the bar beginning on the floor and ending with the lifter standing fully upright. The primary muscles groups involved include the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, spinal erectors, latissimus dorsi, and the forearms/hands.</p><p>In an ideal setup from the floor, the shins are vertical (or as close as you can get, depending on limb lengths), with the shoulders directly over the hands. This can mean slightly different hip heights depending on the person. Alloy Strength recommends the following to determine your proper set up from the floor: 1) begin from a standing position, with your arms long and straight down from the shoulders. 2) Hinge at the hips, pushing them back as far as you can until your hamstrings are tight. 3) Flex or bend your knees the minimum distance you need to get your hands to the bar. This should be your proper starting position, with your hips at the correct height.</p>

Level 7
<p>In a TEMPO RDL, the exercise is assigned a specific tempo for each three phases of movement: the eccentric phase, or muscle lengthening phase, during which the lifter is descending into the pocket, the isometric phase, or a pause in the pocket, and the concentric phase, or muscle shortening phase, during which the lifter is extending the legs to return to upright.The exact tempo will be specified on your Strength Card as such: Eccentric/Isometric/Concentric. So, a 4/1/2 tempo would mean a 4 second descent into the pocket, a 1 second pause in the pocket, and a 2 second ascent to standing. The ascent, or concentric phase, will usually be marked as an “X”, meaning the lifter should attempt to “explode” and move as quickly as possible during this phase. the <b>BB RDL</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 9
<p>The hinge movement pattern is one of the most important to perform to develop total body strength, and chief among hinge exercises is the deadlift. The deadlift involves extension of the hips and knees, with the bar beginning on the floor and ending with the lifter standing fully upright. The primary muscles groups involved include the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, spinal erectors, latissimus dorsi, and the forearms/hands.</p><ul><li>Stance: the stance used for a traditional deadlift is a "power stance", directly under the hips. An easy way to find the proper stance is to close your eyes and take a small hop; your feet should land directly where they need to be. It is important to never “lock” the knees out, and instead keep them “soft” but strong.</li><li>Grip: the three grip options for a barbell deadlift are double overhand (palms down, or pronated), mixed grip (one hand palm up/supinated, one hand palm down/pronated), or hook grip.Trap bar deadlift variations employ a neutral grip, with the palms facing each other. Regardless of grip choice, the goal is to set the bar in the first “crease” of the fingers. This is where we are strongest in holding or pulling movements. Attempting to bury the bar deep in the palm will cause the bar to roll and move, decreasing strength and increasing the risk of blisters or a torn callus. Double overhand is recommended for beginners and non-barbell variations.  Mixed grip is stronger than double overhand, however prolonged use can lead to muscular and structural imbalances in the upper back, shoulders, and spine. Hook grip is the strongest grip to use, but can be painful at first and is considered a more advanced grip variation</li><li>Neutral spine: coaches often use the terms “flat back” or “table top back” to describe spinal positioning. However, this is incorrect as the spine is not truly flat. Every person’s spine has some degree of flexion, or rounding, in the upper back (thoracic region), and some degree of extension, or arching, in the lower back (lumbar region). While the exact degree of flexion and extension varies, and every person’s neutral spine may be a little bit different, a neutral spine is the guaranteed safest posture regardless of movement pattern or body positioning. It is very important to maintain a neutral spine throughout the entire hinge movement to help reduce risk of injury and improve performance.</li><li>Glute lockout: rather than finishing a deadlift by throwing the shoulders back and hyperextending (arching) through the low back, the goal is instead to “tuck” the glutes directly under the shoulders in a neutral posture to complete the lockout. This movement is known as a “posterior pelvic tilt”, and is extremely important for health and function of the lumbar spine and pelvis.</li></ul><p>Not sure how high or low your hips need to be at the start? Ideally the shins are vertical (or as close as you can get, depending on limb lengths), with the shoulders directly over the bar. This can mean slightly different hip heights depending on the person. Alloy Strength recommends the following to determine your proper set up from the floor: 1) begin from a standing position, with your arms long and straight down from the shoulders. 2) Hinge at the hips, pushing them back as far as you can until your hamstrings are tight. 3) Flex or bend your knees the minimum distance you need to get your hands to the bar. This should be your ideal starting position, with your hips at the correct height. This will also guarantee that the bar remains close to the legs over the entire range of motion. The closer the bar remains to the body’s center of mass, the more weight that can be lifted safely.</p>

Level 10
<p>In a SNATCH GRIP RDL, the hands are placed much wider than shoulder width apart. Snatch grip refers to the grip used in the snatch, one of the Olympic weightlifting movements. For an ideal snatch grip width, the bar is placed directly at the hip crease when standing upright. If you hinge slightly and the bar does not begin to slide down the thighs, this is the correct placement. See the <b>BB RDL</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>

Level 11
<p>In a PAUSE RDL, the lifter is assigned a pause in the bottom lengthened position, or “pocket”. This is known as an “isometric contraction”, in which force is produced but there is no muscle length change, and is an excellent way to improve stability and strength. The length of the pause will be specified on your Strength Card, but will typically be 2-5 seconds. See the <b>BB RDL</b> and the <b>BB Snatch Grip RDL</b> descriptions for other coaching cues.</p>
