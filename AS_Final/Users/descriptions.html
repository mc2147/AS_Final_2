<!-- CARRY -->
<!-- Level 1 -->
<p>The carry is arguably the most important pattern for developing total body strength. Humans evolved as bipedal organisms specifically for an upright gait, or walking. Loading the gait is one of the safest and most effective ways to improve strength and stability, and foremost among carry variations is the Farmer Carry. The Farmer Carry (or any gait exercise) involves unilateral \"triple extension\" or extension of the hips, knees, and ankles, with weights held in both hands. The loaded carry involves literally every single muscle group in the body to at least some degree.</p><p>Set your grip correctly by placing the DB handle in the first crease of your fingers and squeezing hard the entire time. A strong grip improves force production of muscle groups through the entire arm and shoulder via the mechanism of muscle irradiation. Muscle irradiation is the phenomenon of creating greater tension/force production in a working muscle due to the innervation/activation of surrounding muscles. Strong glute and abdominal wall activation, which are cues for most exercises and especially carries, is also effective at producing irradiation. Carries force whole-body tension and activation as well as any exercise, creating a strong and rigid pillar (shoulders, spine, and pelvis).</p><p>Depress and retract your shoulder blades to keep a packed shoulder and stable back position, and attempt to keep a symmetrical posture at all times, without allowing the hips or shoulders to tilt in either direction. Focus on a \"heel to toe\ gait, in which a strong foot strike begins at the heel and finishes through the big toe, with the toes pointing forwards (neutral) and the feet directly under the hips.</p>
<!-- Level 2 -->
<p>The suitcase carry involves a unilateral load, with only one dumbbell is used at a time. The suitcase carry can be considered an “anti-lateral flexion” exercise, as the lifter must resist being pulled to the side of the dumbbell and maintaining a neutral and symmetrical posture. An ideal suitcase carry looks exactly the same as a farmer carry, without the shoulders or hips dropping to one side. Be sure to select a weight where you will struggle, but can still maintain a symmetrical posture.</p>
