"<p>The hinge movement pattern is one of the most important to perform to develop total body strength. A common variation of the hinge is the Romanian deadlift, or RDL. The RDL involves flexion and extension of the hips, beginning with the lifter standing fully upright, flexing the hips back or “hinging” until the torso is nearly parallel to the ground, and extending the hips to return upright again. The primary muscles groups involved include the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, spinal erectors, latissimus dorsi, and the forearms/hands.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stance: the stance used for a typical hinge pattern is a "power stance", directly under the hips. An easy way to find the proper stance is to close your eyes and take a small hop; your feet should land directly where they need to be. It is important to never “lock” the knees out, and instead keep them “soft” but strong.</li>
<li>Grip: Alloy Strength recommends using a double overhand grip for RDL, with the bar sliding across the front of the thighs and maintaining contact. The hands should be placed directly below the shoulder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hamstring flexibility and the ability to maintain a neutral spine determine ultimate range of motion for an RDL. The goal of an RDL is to maximize the true hinge capability of the hips, and maintain a vertical shin with minimum flexion or extension of the knee. Proper movement quality will improve range of motion over time.</p>"

<!-- ANT CHAIN 1 -->
<p>While multi joint, compound movements should be the main priority of any training program, accessory exercises can aid in the performance of the main lifts, especially those that improve the lifter’s ability to create a strong, rigid pillar. An excellent exercise to being learning to brace properly through the trunk is the deadbug. The deadbug involves flexion and extension of the hips and shoulders. The exercise begins with the lifter supine (on his/her back), with the arms and legs in the air and the knees bent at 90°. You should look like a dead cockroach in this position. The diagonal (contralateral) arm and leg lower towards the ground while the other limbs remain stationary, so for example the left leg and right leg would extend/flex while the right leg and left arm remain pointed towards the ceiling. This is known as dissociation, and is much harder to do correctly than it first appears. You will often find all 4 limbs wanting to move, and it is a simple yet effective unilateral coordination challenge for the brain. The major muscle groups involved include the rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, internal and external obliques, and spinal erectors.</p>
<p>Alloy Strength typically uses the term “pillar” instead of “core”. Unfortunately the term core has become synonymous with the rectus abdominis, or “6 pack” muscle, when there are many more muscle groups and structures involved in the core. The pillar refers to the shoulders, spine, and pelvis, and any muscle group that attaches to these bony structures. The goal of a strong, rigid pillar is to resist movement and maintain a neutral posture while efficiently transferring force produced by the limbs. The deadbug is a great place to begin with pillar or core training (or what Alloy Strength refers to as “anterior chain” exercises) because it involves every structure of the pillar, as well as both functions of the pillar. Mastering the deadbug can have tremendous carryover to strength, performance, and overall health.</p>
<p>A typical error in the deadbug is to lose proper bracing of the abdominal wall and low back, which causes the movement of the hips to be initiated by the hip flexors instead of the core musculature and leads to an extended low back position that loses contact with the floor. Think instead about drawing your hips towards your shoulders to maintain a neutral spine, and keeping the lower abdominal muscles activated as the leg lowers towards the ground.</p>
