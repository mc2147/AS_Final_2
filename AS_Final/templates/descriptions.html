"<p>The hinge movement pattern is one of the most important to perform to develop total body strength. A common variation of the hinge is the Romanian deadlift, or RDL. The RDL involves flexion and extension of the hips, beginning with the lifter standing fully upright, flexing the hips back or “hinging” until the torso is nearly parallel to the ground, and extending the hips to return upright again. The primary muscles groups involved include the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, spinal erectors, latissimus dorsi, and the forearms/hands.</p>

<li>Stance: the stance used for a typical hinge pattern is a "power stance", directly under the hips. An easy way to find the proper stance is to close your eyes and take a small hop; your feet should land directly where they need to be. It is important to never “lock” the knees out, and instead keep them “soft” but strong.</li>
<li>Grip: Alloy Strength recommends using a double overhand grip for RDL, with the bar sliding across the front of the thighs and maintaining contact. The hands should be placed directly below the shoulder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hamstring flexibility and the ability to maintain a neutral spine determine ultimate range of motion for an RDL. The goal of an RDL is to maximize the true hinge capability of the hips, and maintain a vertical shin with minimum flexion or extension of the knee. Proper movement quality will improve range of motion over time.</p>"
